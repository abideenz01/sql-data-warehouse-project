## 🏗️ Data Architecture

###The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:


1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV/Excel Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

###This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

## Objective
###Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

## Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
